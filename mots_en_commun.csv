5 reasons why no one has built a better EpiPen	"[oston mom Denise Clark has been buying EpiPens annually for the past 16 years, ever since her son was diagnosed with a serious peanut allergy., Problem is, he won’t carry his EpiPen around with him — because it won’t fit into his pocket., This underscores a simple truth: EpiPens just aren’t that great., Though EpiPens come with a practice kit, users in the midst of an allergy attack have mistaken which end’s the pointy end — and stabbed their thumbs instead of their thighs., The devices have come under fire in the past month for their escalating sticker price: a pack of two EpiPens now lists for $608., Mylan, which owns the EpiPen brand (though the device itself is actually manufactured by Pfizer) notes that it redesigned the product in 2009, added features including the flip-top case, and is ""investing substantial amounts in research into additional improvements, such as a formulation with a longer shelf life."", But critics say Mylan has little incentive to improve EpiPens: ""If you’re the monopolist, and you’ve got a product that expires every year, and it’s not super easy to carry around so the safest thing to do is have several tucked away in different places — I don’t see why there would be any pressure to innovate,"" said Nicholson Price, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School who studies health care regulation and patent law., ""EpiPen’s flaws seem like features, not a bug,"" Price said., Competitors have tried to make runs at the EpiPen., But Mylan has a lock on the particular EpiPen design that millions of patients, parents, and school nurses have come to trust., The company’s main innovation has been a bright orange cap that covers the needle, but releases automatically when a patient pushes an EpiPen against her thigh, so there’s no need to stop and unscrew the cover in the midst of an allergy attack., The very fact that the EpiPen has been dominant for so long makes it hard for challengers to come in with a radically different design., ""It would not be very difficult to create an EpiPen product, in terms of engineering,"" Allen said., Windgap’s device is meant to improve upon the EpiPen: It’s supposed to be smaller, about the size of a Bic lighter, with a much more stable formulation of epinephrine intended to survive in a pants pocket without getting overheated., Though EpiPen components look pretty basic, Mylan notes that it is made up of 26 parts and must be able to deliver the drug with a sterile needle within seconds., One EpiPen alternative that did make it to market: The Auvi-Q, an epinephrine auto-injector shaped like a bulky credit card., ""We could make something very tiny, that you could carry on a keychain — much smaller than an EpiPen or auto-injector by far,"" MannKind CEO Matthew Pfeffer said., A lot of the challenge lies in the regulatory system, said Mark Baum, CEO of San Diego-based Imprimis — a compound pharmaceutical company that’s working on a cheaper alternative to the EpiPen., ""But when the market was more normalized — when the EpiPen was only retailing around $100 — competitors questioned whether it was worth taking that risk."", Public anger at EpiPen is so high right now that Baum figures it is worth taking the risk., 5., But though she works in the field every day, she says she never even thought much about the flaws of the EpiPen design — or the lack of innovation — until the product started hitting headlines., But since the EpiPen is generally covered by insurance, many customers have simply gone with it., ""They have such a monopoly, so why would they bother improving the EpiPen?""]"	['1.

Why Women Are No Longer Catching Up To Men On Pay	[Hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions., So as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall., But that premium itself isn’t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average)., Rather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours., And even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: Women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men — there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates — yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers.]	['men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours']
